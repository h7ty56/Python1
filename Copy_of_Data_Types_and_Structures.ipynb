        "\n",
        "Reasons for Immutability:\n",
        "1. Memory Safety: By making tuples immutable, Python ensures that the data they contain is not accidentally modified, which helps prevent memory-related bugs.\n",
        "2. Thread Safety: Immutable data structures like tuples are thread-safe, meaning they can be safely accessed and shared between multiple threads without fear of data corruption.\n",
        "3. Hashability: Tuples can be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable and can be hashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consequences of Immutability:\n",
        "1. Cannot Assign New Values: You cannot assign new values to tuple elements using indexing (e.g., my_tuple[0] = 'new_value').\n",
        "2. Cannot Delete Elements: You cannot delete elements from a tuple using the del statement (e.g., del my_tuple[0]).\n",
        "3. Cannot Modify Elements: You cannot modify tuple elements in place (e.g., my_tuple[0].append('new_value')).\n",
