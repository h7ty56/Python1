        "A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of web service that follows the principles of REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. It allows systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.\n",

        "Key Principles of RESTful APIs:\n",
        "Stateless: Each request from a client contains all the necessary information, and the server does not store client state between requests.\n",
        "Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities, allowing for better scalability and flexibility.\n",
        "Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs use consistent and predictable URLs and HTTP methods.\n",
        "Resource-Based: Everything in a RESTful API is treated as a resource (e.g., users, products), each identified by a unique URL.\n",
        "Use of HTTP Methods:\n",
        "GET → Retrieve a resource\n",
        "POST → Create a new resource\n",
        "PUT → Update an existing resource\n",
        "DELETE → Remove a resource\n",
        "Representation of Resources: Data is usually exchanged in JSON or XML format.\n",
